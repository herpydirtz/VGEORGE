User can create a "shopping list" - virtual and physical use, assistant will ask if the list is virtual or physical, then create a list. The virtual list pulls information from sites like google or amazon to create a virtual shopping cart where you can check out, and the physical cart will allow you to add items to a list. This list can be sent to a delivery method of choice, ie email, SMS, etc.
